**README for ATM Withdrawal Web Application**

This project is a simple web based ATM simulation created using Python and Flask. It allows a user to perform basic ATM actions such as entering a PIN, depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the current account balance. The goal of the project is to demonstrate how backend logic and frontend design can work together to create a basic banking system.

The project includes three main operations. The user can add money to the account using the deposit feature. The user can take out money using the withdrawal feature as long as the balance is sufficient. The user can also check the current balance at any time. All actions require the correct PIN to be entered before any operation is completed.

The frontend is built using simple HTML and CSS to keep the design clean and easy to understand. The backend includes the Python logic that handles the balance updates and PIN verification. The balance is stored in a Python variable which is updated whenever a transaction takes place.

This project is meant for beginners who want to understand how a basic ATM system works in a web environment. It is also a good example of how to connect a user interface with backend logic. The code is simple, readable, and easy to modify.
